**Insurance Cost Prediction Model**

### Overview:
This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting insurance costs based on various factors such as age, BMI, smoking habits, region, etc. The model is trained on a dataset of insurance records and corresponding attributes.

### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### Installation:
1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/RaiKumarAman/Predicting-Health-Insurance-Cost.git


2. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

### Dataset:
The dataset used for training the model is included in this repository. However, you can obtain a similar dataset from various sources such as Kaggle or insurance industry databases.

### Usage:
1. Navigate to the `notebooks` directory.
2. Open the `Insurance_Cost_Prediction.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions.

### Model Evaluation:
The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R-squared value. These metrics are displayed in the notebook along with visualizations for better understanding.

### Prediction:
Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict insurance costs for new individuals by providing their attributes such as age, BMI, smoking habits, region, etc., as input to the model.
